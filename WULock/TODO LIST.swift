 TODO LIST
 Just a list of stuff we either need to or could do. Feel free to add.
 
 - AR Tools:
    (X) get good reference images
    ( ) let user select combinations to use
    ( ) display instructions
    ( ) allow instruction navigation
 - Vault:
    ( ) show detail view for item when tapped
    ( ) for mail combo and gym combo, enforce rules for entry
    ( ) sorting and filtering
    ( ) display "No items message"
    ( ) don't cover fields with keyboard, slide table up
    ( ) delete/edit items
    ( ) let online items link to browser
 - ID Scanner:
    ( ) display bigger version when card is tapped
    ( ) allow replacement of image (could be same view)
    ( ) display overlay while taking picture so user knows what rectangle is being selected
    ( ) maybe link with vault? so id type record could have image?
 - General/Misc:
    ( ) touch id or passcode to lock vault
    ( ) hide passwords
    ( ) maybe implement Password AutoFill API? https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/
    ( ) sync vault with icloud (this is a last priority)
